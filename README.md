# LED flame simulation
There is lot of cheep flame simulating LED lights on the chinese market. They usualy produce "random" flame pattern which is not very random and it is possible to see repeating elements in it very easily. You can see it in the short video below.

I have found that all of the lamps I have bought are fitted with an unmarked chip that is pin compatible with the Attiny 412. I even originally thought it was the Attiny, but the programmer won't communicate with it at all, so it must be some other chip.

Since the chips are easily accessible and easy to disconnect with hot air, I decided to try replacing them with Attiny 412s with my own program.
